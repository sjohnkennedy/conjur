Feature: Authenticator status check

  Conjur supports a Status check where users can get immediate feedback
  on authenticator configuration.

  The Status check includes general checks (webservice is loaded, user is authorized
  to check the Authenticator status, etc.) and authenticator-specific checks (e.g in
  OIDC we check that the `provider-uri` variable is loaded and has a value).

  Scenarios in this file test only the general checks. Authenticator specific checks
  should go in a separate file (e.g authn_status_oidc.feature).

  We use the OIDC authenticator in these scenarios as an authenticator that
  implements the Status check but all these test are not OIDC-specific and do
  not require a running OIDC Provider in order to run.
