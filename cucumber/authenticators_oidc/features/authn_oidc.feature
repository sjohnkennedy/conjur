Feature: OIDC Authenticator - Hosts can authenticate with OIDC authenticator

  In this feature we define an OIDC authenticator in policy and perform authentication
  with Conjur. In successful scenarios we will also define a variable and permit the host to
  execute it, to verify not only that the host can authenticate with the OIDC
  Authenticator, but that it can retrieve a secret using the Conjur access token.
